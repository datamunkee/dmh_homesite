[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) provide a simple way to make a
website using
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and
[git](https://git-scm.com).

Aspects of making a website are

- Working with html and css and javascript
- Finding a hosting site
- Transferring stuff to the hosting site, updates and live updates

Pain of using GitHub:

- using PAT on the commandline
- using ssh on the commandline
- having multiple gh accounts on same machine
- useHttpPath or Not
